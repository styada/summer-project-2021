#Etiquette for adding to project(s): Make a branch that stems off the devel branch. This will give you the most up-to-date info regarding the project. 
                                     Only push to master once the ENTIRE project(s) is FINISHED. This prevents us from having unusable code on the master branch to show interviewers.
                                     All branches must be named in the following syntax so that we can properly track what changes are made from what branch : '<Issue-label>/#<issue_no>:[Changes made listed in bullet points]'.
                                     Every feature MUST have a matching issue. You can open issues in the issue tab. Make sure to label your issues with any of the pre-created issue labels or any new ones you created. Then make sure to create branches using the label.
                                     Do NOT push buggy code to devel, check everything in a secondary branch and only push working code to devel.
